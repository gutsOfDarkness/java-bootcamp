# Chapter 5: Operators and Expressions

## Understanding Operators: The Language of Computation

Operators are the fundamental building blocks that allow you to perform operations on variables and values. They are like mathematical symbols that tell the computer what kind of computation or manipulation to perform. In Java, operators are categorized into several types, each serving a specific purpose in computational logic.

## Categories of Operators

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations on numeric values.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `+` | Addition | `int sum = 5 + 3;  // Result: 8` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `int difference = 10 - 4;  // Result: 6` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `int product = 6 * 7;  // Result: 42` |
| `/` | Division | `int quotient = 15 / 3;  // Result: 5` |
| `%` | Modulus (Remainder) | `int remainder = 17 % 5;  // Result: 2` |

### 2. Comparison Operators
These operators compare two values and return a boolean result.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `==` | Equal to | `boolean isEqual = (5 == 5);  // true` |
| `!=` | Not equal to | `boolean isDifferent = (5 != 3);  // true` |
| `>` | Greater than | `boolean isGreater = (10 > 5);  // true` |
| `<` | Less than | `boolean isLess = (3 < 7);  // true` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | `boolean isGreaterOrEqual = (5 >= 5);  // true` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | `boolean isLessOrEqual = (4 <= 6);  // true` |

### 3. Logical Operators
Logical operators work with boolean values, allowing complex conditional logic.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `&&` | Logical AND | `boolean result = (true && false);  // false` |
| `||` | Logical OR | `boolean result = (true || false);  // true` |
| `!` | Logical NOT | `boolean result = !(true);  // false` |

### 4. Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `=` | Simple assignment | `int x = 10;` |
| `+=` | Add and assign | `x += 5;  // Equivalent to x = x + 5` |
| `-=` | Subtract and assign | `x -= 3;  // Equivalent to x = x - 3` |
| `*=` | Multiply and assign | `x *= 2;  // Equivalent to x = x * 2` |
| `/=` | Divide and assign | `x /= 2;  // Equivalent to x = x / 2` |

## Operator Precedence

Just like in mathematics, Java follows a specific order of operations. Operators have different precedence levels:

1. Parentheses `()`
2. Unary operators (`++`, `--`, `!`)
3. Multiplicative (`*`, `/`, `%`)
4. Additive (`+`, `-`)
5. Relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
6. Equality (`==`, `!=`)
7. Logical AND `&&`
8. Logical OR `||`
9. Assignment operators

## Expressions: Combining Operators and Values

An expression is a combination of operators, variables, and method calls that evaluates to a single value. 

```java
// Simple expression
int result = 5 + 3 * 2
// Complex expression with multiple operators
double calculateBonus(double salary, boolean isPerformanceExcellent, int yearsOfService) {
    double bonusRate = (isPerformanceExcellent ? 0.15 : 0.10) * (1 + (yearsOfService / 10.0));
    return salary * bonusRate;
}
```

## Expressions and Type Conversion
Expressions often involve type conversion, which can happen implicitly or explicitly:

**Implicit Type Conversion (Widening)**
```java
int intValue = 100;
long longValue = intValue;  // Automatic conversion
double doubleValue = longValue;  // Another automatic conversion
```
# Code Examples

## Example 1: Arithmetic and Comparison Operators (Problem Statement)
**Problem:** Create a program that demonstrates various arithmetic and comparison operators in a practical scenario.

```java
public class OperatorDemonstration {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Arithmetic operations
        int x = 10;
        int y = 3;
        
        System.out.println("Addition: " + (x + y));        // 13
        System.out.println("Subtraction: " + (x - y));     // 7
        System.out.println("Multiplication: " + (x * y));  // 30
        System.out.println("Division: " + (x / y));        // 3
        System.out.println("Remainder: " + (x % y));       // 1

        // Comparison operations
        boolean isGreater = x > y;
        boolean isEqual = x == y;
        boolean isNotEqual = x != y;

        System.out.println("Is x greater than y? " + isGreater);
        System.out.println("Is x equal to y? " + isEqual);
        System.out.println("Is x not equal to y? " + isNotEqual);
    }
}
```

## Example 2: Logical Operators (Problem Statement)
**Problem:** Develop a program that uses logical operators to create complex conditional logic for a simple age verification system.

```java
public class AgeVerificationSystem {
    public static void checkEligibility(int age, boolean hasParentalConsent) {
        // Complex logical expression
        boolean isEligible = (age >= 18) || (age >= 16 && hasParentalConsent);
        
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Parental Consent: " + hasParentalConsent);
        System.out.println("Eligible for Activity: " + isEligible);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test different scenarios
        checkEligibility(17, true);   // Eligible with parental consent
        checkEligibility(19, false);  // Eligible by age
        checkEligibility(15, false); // Not eligible
    }
}
```

## Example 3: Assignment and Compound Operators (Problem Statement)
**Problem:** Create a program that demonstrates various assignment operators and their impact on variable values.

```java
public class AssignmentOperatorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int balance = 1000;
        
        // Basic assignment
        balance = 1500;  // Direct assignment
        
        // Compound assignment operators
        balance += 500;  // Equivalent to balance = balance + 500
        balance -= 200;  // Equivalent to balance = balance - 200
        balance *= 2;    // Equivalent to balance = balance * 2
        balance /= 2;    // Equivalent to balance = balance / 2

        System.out.println("Final Balance: " + balance);
        
        // Demonstrating increment and decrement
        int counter = 10;
        System.out.println("Pre-increment: " + (++counter));  // 11
        System.out.println("Post-decrement: " + (counter--)); // 11
        System.out.println("After decrement: " + counter);    // 10
    }
}
```
