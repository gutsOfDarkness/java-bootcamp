# Chapter 11: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Theoretical Overview (1000 words)

### The Evolution of Programming Paradigms
Before diving into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), it's crucial to understand how programming methodologies have evolved. Traditional procedural programming approached software development as a series of sequential instructions, much like a recipe following step-by-step procedures. While effective for simple tasks, this approach became increasingly challenging as software systems grew more complex.

Object-Oriented Programming emerged as a revolutionary approach that mirrors how we understand and interact with the real world. Instead of focusing solely on actions and procedures, OOP centers on creating "objects" that combine data and behavior, much like how we think about entities in our daily lives.

### Core Concepts of OOP

#### 1. Classes and Objects
Think of a class as a blueprint and an object as a specific instance created from that blueprint. 

**Class Analogy**: Consider a car manufacturing blueprint. The blueprint (class) defines the characteristics and behaviors all cars of that model will have - like number of wheels, engine type, and methods like start(), stop(), and accelerate(). An actual car rolling off the assembly line would be an object.

```java
// Class definition
class Car {
    // Attributes (data)
    String color;
    String model;
    
    // Behaviors (methods)
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car is starting");
    }
}

// Object creation
Car myCar = new Car();
```

#### 2. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and behaviors while allowing for specialization.

**Inheritance Analogy**: Imagine a general "Vehicle" class with basic characteristics, and then specific classes like "Car", "Motorcycle", and "Truck" that inherit from it but add their unique characteristics.

```java
class Vehicle {
    void move() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is moving");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void honk() {
        System.out.println("Car is honking");
    }
}
```

#### 3. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms.

**Polymorphism Analogy**: Consider a "Shape" class with a "calculateArea()" method. Different shapes like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle can implement this method uniquely.

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double calculateArea();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    double radius;
    
    double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

#### 4. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is about bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, and controlling access to them.

**Encapsulation Analogy**: Think of a secure bank vault. The internal mechanisms are hidden, but controlled interfaces allow specific interactions.

```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance;  // Hidden from direct external access
    
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 5. Abstraction
Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors.

**Abstraction Analogy**: When driving a car, you interact with a simplified interface (steering wheel, pedals) without needing to understand the intricate engine mechanics.

```java
interface DatabaseConnector {
    void connect();
    void disconnect();
}
```

### Why OOP Matters
1. **Modularity**: Breaking complex systems into manageable, independent objects
2. **Reusability**: Leveraging inheritance and composition
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to modify and extend existing code
4. **Real-world Mapping**: More intuitive representation of complex systems

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Basic OOP Concept Demonstration
**Problem Statement**: Create a simple library management system demonstrating basic OOP principles.

```java
public class Book {
    // Encapsulated attributes
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private boolean isAvailable;
    
    // Constructor
    public Book(String title, String author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.isAvailable = true;
    }
    
    // Methods demonstrating behavior
    public void borrowBook() {
        if (isAvailable) {
            isAvailable = false;
            System.out.println(title + " has been borrowed.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(title + " is already borrowed.");
        }
    }
    
    public void returnBook() {
        isAvailable = true;
        System.out.println(title + " has been returned.");
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Inheritance and Polymorphism
**Problem Statement**: Develop an employee management system showcasing inheritance.

```java
abstract class Employee {
    protected String name;
    protected double baseSalary;
    
    // Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses
    public abstract double calculateTotalSalary();
}

class FullTimeEmployee extends Employee {
    private double bonus;
    
    @Override
    public double calculateTotalSalary() {
        return baseSalary + bonus;
    }
}

class ContractEmployee extends Employee {
    private int workingHours;
    private double hourlyRate;
    
    @Override
    public double calculateTotalSalary() {
        return workingHours * hourlyRate;
    }
}
```

### Example 3: Complex OOP Application
**Problem Statement**: Create a simple banking system demonstrating multiple OOP principles.

```java
class BankAccount {
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;
    
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposited: $" + amount);
        }
    }
    
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrawn: $" + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds");
        }
    }
}
```
